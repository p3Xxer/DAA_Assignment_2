We have implemented the following algorithms\+: 1) Ford-\/\+Fulkerson Algorithm 2) Line Fitting Algorithm \hypertarget{index_a}{}\doxysubsection{Ford-\/\+Fulkerson Algorithm}\label{index_a}
This algorithm is used to find the maximum flow in a network. It is implemented using the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. We use the Ford-\/\+Fulkerson algorithm for solving Bipartite Matching problems. We ran the algorithm on different kinds of network flow graphs. Smaller graphs were used to verify the correctness of the algorithm. Larger graphs were used to test the efficiency of the algorithm.
